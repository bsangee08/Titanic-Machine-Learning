File description
-----------------

Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, 
also known as the “ground truth”.

The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.

Results.csv contains the prediction results for test dataset (test.csv)

Titanic.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file and the code is in Python.
